# HASM Syntax Handbook    
    
## ðŸ§  Philosophy    
    
HASM (Human Assembly) is a pseudo-assembly language designed to make low-level programming readable, expressive, and clean â€” without sacrificing control over registers, memory, or performance. It bridges the gap between raw assembly and high-level scripting by combining:    
    
* Readable syntax (inspired by Lua, JS, Python)    
* Typed memory and register operations    
* Modern control flow structures    
* Human-centric programming while staying hardware-aware
