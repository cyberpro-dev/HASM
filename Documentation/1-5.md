    
## 1. Lexical Overview    
    
* Whitespace is ignored (except inside strings).    
* Case-sensitive (`eax` is not `EAX`).    
* No semicolons or braces. Blocks are ended using `end`.

## 2. Comments    
    
### Single-line Comments    
    
```hasm    
-- This is a single-line comment    
```    
    
### Multi-line Comments    
    
```hasm    
/*    
This is a multi-line comment.    
You can describe whole sections of code here.    
*/    
```    
    
Use these for documentation or to temporarily disable large code blocks.

## 3. Data Types    
    
```hasm    
byte       ; 8-bit unsigned    
int8       ; 8-bit signed    
uint8      ; 8-bit unsigned    
int16      ; 16-bit signed    
uint16     ; 16-bit unsigned    
int32      ; 32-bit signed    
uint32     ; 32-bit unsigned    
int64      ; 64-bit signed    
uint64     ; 64-bit unsigned    
float32    ; 32-bit floating point    
float64    ; 64-bit floating point    
bool       ; true/false    
char       ; single byte ASCII character    
string     ; string literal    
ptr        ; architecture-sized pointer    
```    
    
Use these types to clarify memory operations, register content, or variable declarations.

## 4. Variable Declarations    
    
```hasm    
local x = 5    
local int: y = 10    
set eax = 5    
set int: eax = 1    
```    
    
### Typed Variables    
    
```hasm    
local uint16: counter = 0    
```    
    
`local` creates a scoped variable. `set` modifies existing variables or registers. Prefixes like `int:`, `uint32:` specify the expected type.

## 5. Control Flow    
    
### If Statement    
    
```hasm    
if [[var(x) > 5]] then    
  set eax = 1    
end    
```    
    
### While Loop    
    
```hasm    
while [[var(i) < 10]] then    
  change i: +1    
end    
```    
    
### For-each (future feature)    
    
```hasm    
foreach item in list then    
  log(item)    
end    
```
