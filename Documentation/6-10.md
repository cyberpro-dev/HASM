### Basic Operations    
    
```hasm    
set eax = eax + 5    
set ebx = eax * 2    
```    
    
### Change Statement    
    
```hasm    
change i: +1    
change eax: -var(j)    
```    
- `change` mutates a variable or register with inline math.    
    
    
### Del/delete Statement    
    
```hasm    
del i    
del eax: -var(j)    
```    
    
```hasm    
delete i    
delete eax: -var(j)    
```    
- `del`/`delete` deletes a variable or register.

## 7. Memory Access    
    
### Write to Memory    
    
```hasm    
mem[uint16: 0x200] = eax    
mem[uint8: SCREEN + offset] = 65    
```    
    
### Read from Memory    
    
```hasm    
local value = mem[uint32: 0x1000]    
```    
    
Memory addressing supports math and symbols:    
    
```hasm    
mem[uint8: ptr + 1] = 0xFF    
```

## 8. Functions    
    
```hasm    
function myFunc()    
  set eax = 1    
end    
```    
    
Functions are declared with `function name()` and closed with `end`. Return support is planned for future updates.

## 9. Labels and Jumps    
    
### Define a Label    
    
```hasm    
label myLoop    
```    
    
### Jump to a Label    
    
```hasm    
jump('myLoop')    
```

## 10. I/O Ports    
    
```hasm    
out 0x60, al      -- Output to port    
in al, 0x60       -- Input from port    
```
