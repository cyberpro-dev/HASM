## 16. Structs and Arrays

### 🧱 Structs

Declare a `struct` using natural-style syntax. Structs are just typed memory layouts.

```hasm
struct Vec2
  float32: x
  float32: y
end
```

Use with pointers or memory labels:

```hasm
define POINT = 0x5000

mem write 1.5 bit32 POINT         -- x
mem write 3.0 bit32 POINT + 4     -- y
```

Or define inline:

```hasm
local Vec2: origin
set origin.x = 0
set origin.y = 0
```

### 📦 Arrays

Use array-style declarations for memory or locals.

```hasm
local int32[5]: nums
set nums[0] = 10
set nums[1] = 20
```

Memory-style array access:

```hasm
mem[uint8: SCREEN + 5] = 0x41
```

Supports expressions in indices:

```hasm
set nums[var(i)] = 99
```

Arrays + structs = 💪 full-blown data modeling.

## 17. Break and Continue

### 🔄 `break`

Break exits the nearest loop.

```hasm
while [[var(i) < 10]] then
  if [[var(i) == 5]] then
    break
  end
  change i: +1
end
```

### 🔄 `continue`

Continue skips to the next iteration of the loop.

```hasm
while [[var(i) < 10]] then
  if [[var(i) % 2 == 0]] then
    continue
  end
  log("Odd:", var(i))
  change i: +1
end
```

Both are valid in `while` and `foreach` loops.  
They compile into jump structures that preserve control flow readability.

## 18. Future Features    
    
* `debug log(...)` and `assert(...)`    
* `switch/case` style branching    
* Module system (`import`, `include`)    
* Inline `asm {}` blocks for raw escapes    
* Type annotations for function arguments and returns
